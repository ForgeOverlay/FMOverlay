# Forge Master Stats Overlay

## What it does

Shows you how good your item stats are by displaying colored percentages:
- **Green (90-100%)** - Great roll
- **Yellow (60-89%)** - Decent roll  
- **Red (0-59%)** - Poor roll

Also lets you compare two items side-by-side to see if swapping is worth it.

**Wrong item name** - OCR isn't perfect, but the stats should still work correctly

**Button not appearing** - Check the Service tab and make sure the overlay is running
